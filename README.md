Prerequisites for building the project OpenScanTools in Debug, Release

Install Qt 5
==============================================================================

* Download the installer at https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer
* Install version 5.15.2 and the corresponding binaries for your developpement environment (i.e. MSVC 2019 64-bit)
* /!\ Qt 6 is not supported.
* source code and optional Qt modules are not needed (it can save a lot of space)
* Allow for executing binaries by adding the current path to your "PATH" environment variable: <qt_install_dir>5.15.2\msvc2019_64\bin\

Install the Vulkan SDK
==============================================================================

* Download the version 1.2.148 (or higher) at https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
* Install the SDK. You can let the default installation location or choose another. In any case the ENV variables are automatically configured.
* Warning: if your user name (in Windows) contains a space, you may have shaders compiling errors in case the code is copied in your user folder. If so, move the code in a path with no space.

Configure Visual Studio
==============================================================================

* General project properties:
    * right-click on the project "OpenScanTools" -> Properties
    * Debugging -> Working Directory -> set to `$(SolutionDir)`
    * Do this for every compilation configuration

Install Qt VS Tool:
==============================================================================

It is a plugin needed to compile the Qt dependencies (moc, ui, qrc).

You can find it in Tools->Extensions and Updates->Qt Visual Stutio Tools.

Add the path where Qt is installed on your machine in:

* Qt VS Tools->Qt Options->Qt Versions->Add (i.e. `C:\Qt\5.12.x\msvc2017_64`)

Generate doc:
==============================================================================
* Download the doxygen 1.9.1 at https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html
* Install it. The ENV variables aren't automatically configured. Add the doxygen/bin path to your system path.
* You can generate the doc (in the "doc" folder) with generateDoc.bat

  
Build with Inno Setup:
==============================================================================
* Download and install the last version of Inno Setup : https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
* Launch OpenScanTools.sln solution with Visual Studio
